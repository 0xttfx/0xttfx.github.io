Hey! I&#39;m Faioli, aka 0xttfx 🏴‍☠️

Enthusiast of geek and hacker culture!

With over 25 years of experience in the job market, I have learned a lot from many people I have met along the way! And I am very grateful to everyone who gave me good and bad examples, who shared knowledge, who tried to bring me down, who discredited me... It was, and still is: a great school where I continue to improve my skills in IT infrastructure, network troubleshooting, Unix and Linux, telecom, systems administration, virtualization, SND&amp;NFV, cloud computing and, in recent years, in infrastructure as code, provisioning automation, continuous integrations, platform engineering and cybersecurity.&#34;

Basic observations have become natural guidelines

- Don&#39;t try to be someone you are not
- Don&#39;t expect anything from anyone.
- Don&#39;t be ashamed of being ridiculed when asking questions.
- Express ideas and don&#39;t impute them.
- Accept criticism.
- Deal with &#34;Ad hominem&#34; attacks with silence: let the biped&#39;s ego shine in its spectrum: poor thing, he needs it!
- Treat everyone with respect! Even when you disagree.
- There is a time to complain! First, shake off the dust, breathe and solve the problem.
- Accept your mistakes and update yourself.
- And studying without practicing is not the best way... Especially if you have ADHD... lol
- About social engineering, the only practice, compelled as an organic side effect of my disinterest in certain social interactions engendered by narcissistic intellectual profiles: give the contemptuous eyes that judge you, the food they want! It is instructive to observe being defined by the latent obtuseness of myopic pride. But in my case it is based as the colloquial antidote that goes beyond! Because it strengthens positions that support essential fiduciary narratives of self-defense.

&gt;Enlightenment is man&#39;s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one&#39;s understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! [dare to know] &#34;Have courage to use your own understanding!&#34; — that is the motto of enlightenment.
&gt;
&gt;Immanuel Kant
&gt;
&gt;[a piece the text: &#34;What is Enlightenment?&#34; - Konigsberg in Prussia, 30 September 1784]

Have fun at this place and get in touch if you want...
